# Intuition
Access each element using loop and working on it.

# Approach
Used for loop to get indexes, int the each indexed element we choose 11th and 12th index and convert them into integer by subtracting the '0' as ascii value. and converting it into a whole digit by getting 10s and 1s place and adding it. Finally checking using if condition

# Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

# Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int countSeniors(vector<string>& details) {

        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<details.size(); i++){
            string index = details[i]; //11 and 12
            
            cout<<index[11]<<index[12]<<endl;
            int age = (index[11] - '0') * 10 + (index[12] - '0');

            if(age > 60){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;

    }
};
