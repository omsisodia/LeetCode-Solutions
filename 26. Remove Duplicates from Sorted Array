# Intuition
Remove all the occurences of elements that are multiple and return the count

# Approach
To remove duplicates from a sorted array, I employed a combination of the std::unique and erase functions from the C++ Standard Library. The std::unique function is adept at reordering the elements such that all unique elements are pushed to the front of the vector, followed by duplicates. It then provides an iterator that marks the end of the unique elements. Using this iterator, the erase method removes all elements beyond this point from the vector.

# Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

# Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        nums.erase(unique(nums.begin(), nums.end()), nums.end());
        return nums.size();
    }
};
