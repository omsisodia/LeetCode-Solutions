Intuition
Traverse from the end and look for first space " " and break the loop and return the count.

Approach
The approach involves iterating through the string in reverse order, counting the characters until a non-space character is encountered, indicating the start of the last word. Once the count begins, it continues until a space is encountered again, signifying the end of the last word.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = s.length() - 1 ; i >= 0; i--){
            if(s[i] != ' '){
                count++;
            } 
            else if(count > 0){ 
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
