# Intuition
Reverse the number and compare.

# Approach
Store the main variable x in temp, so that while reversing the number we don't change the variable x that we have to compare later. Store the reverse in some variable and then compare it with x.

# Complexity
Time complexity:
O(log10 x) log x with base 10

Space complexity:
O(1)

# Solution

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        
        int temp = x;
        long long rev_num = 0;
        while(temp > 0){
            rev_num = rev_num * 10 + temp % 10; 
            temp = temp / 10; 
        }

        cout<<x<<endl;
        cout<<rev_num;

        if(x == rev_num) return true;
        
        return false;
    }

    
};
