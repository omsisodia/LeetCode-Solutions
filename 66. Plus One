# Intuition
When adding one to a number, if the digit is less than 9, we can simply increment it. However, if the digit is 9, it turns into 0, and we carry over the addition to the next digit on the left. If all digits are 9, we need to add an additional digit (1) at the beginning.

# Approach
Start from the rightmost digit and iterate leftwards. If a digit is not 9, increment it and return the array. If it is 9, set it to 0 and continue to the next digit. If all digits are 9, insert 1 at the beginning of the array and return it.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        
        int n = digits.size();

        for(int i = n -1; i>=0; i--){

            if(digits[i] != 9){
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }

            digits[i] = 0;
        }

        digits.insert(digits.begin(), 1);
        return digits;
    }
};
