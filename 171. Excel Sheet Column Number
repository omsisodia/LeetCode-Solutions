# Intuition
The problem involves converting an Excel column title (e.g., "A", "Z", "AA") to its corresponding column number. The column title follows a base-26 numeral system where 'A' represents 1 and 'Z' represents 26, and this system continues with 'AA' as 27, 'AB' as 28, and so on.

# Approach
Initialize result to 0: This will store the final column number.
Iterate over each character in the columnTitle:
-> Convert the character to its corresponding value (e.g., 'A' to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., 'Z' to 26).
-> Update the result by multiplying the current result by 26 and adding the value of the current character.
Return the final result

class Solution {
public:
    int titleToNumber(string columnTitle) {
        int result = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i<columnTitle.size(); i++){
            int ascii_from_0 =  columnTitle[i] - 'A' + 1;
            cout<<ascii_from_0<<endl;

            result = result * 26 + ascii_from_0;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
